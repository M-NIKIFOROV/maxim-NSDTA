As the court magistrate  I feel for some of the officials who are equally important as me are not receiving allowances. We did our best to raise our concerns to the LLG and District authorities to look into this matter  but have always fall on deaf ears. One official have been without allowances and without pay for 18 years and that is too long. As human he has family and needs financial support. 18 years is too long.  I can only  hope the matter is look into immediately.,eb9dc021ca4296b178f71d5c830bea0

They lack a court house and have been sitting at the basketball court for hearings. This is a problem as there is no privacy and there are always children running around.  The delays in allowances has led to a lot of people rejecting or not wanting to work with the village court. This issue of payment has made the morale of people to drop in serving the community.
