## PNG National Service Delivery and Trends Assessment
## Project Overview
The National Service Delivery and Trends Assessment (NSDTA), to be implemented in 2025, is a large-scale survey of service provision that will investigate service delivery at the sub-national level in 34 Districts across Papua New Guinea (PNG) and in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (ARoB). It is the successor to the groundbreaking Public Expenditure and Service Delivery (PESD) study of 2002, conducted by PNG’s National Research Institute (NRI) and the World Bank, and the Promoting Effective Public Expenditure (PEPE) study of 2012, conducted by the NRI and the Australian National University. Building on this earlier work, the nationally representative NSDTA will provide a deep understanding of how public financing, governance and service delivery currently work in practice across PNG.

By tracing national budgetary allocations to provincial and district levels, and then to front-line facilities, the research will offer critical insights into where public financing succeeds, or fails, to deliver basic services to Papua New Guinean communities. Importantly it will provide trend data on the state of health and education services across the country, and insights into the impact of policy and financing reforms in both the sectors. In addition, it will provide for the first time, similar data on the law and justice sector. In doing so it responds to the PNG Government’s acknowledged need for “reliable and timely data across all levels of Government” and its call for “Development Partner programs to be coordinated with the MTDP Framework for greater sector outcomes” (See: Medium term Development Plan IV 2023-2027:68).PNG.

## Objectives
Designed to support PNG’s policy priorities and its development agenda by delivering robust and difficult-to-source panel data to support informed decision-making and evidence-based planning, the NSDTA has four overall objectives, namely:

1. To analyse the impact of major PNG Government expenditure reforms, assess the success or otherwise of those reforms in translating budget allocations into effective service delivery performance, and to understand the reasons for their success or failure;

2. To make service delivery performance data available to PNG’s political and bureaucratic leadership, donors, civil society and general public in order to promote more effective and more transparent budget allocations and expenditure practices;

3. To build the research and analytical capacity of PNG-based researchers individually and at the institutional level; and

4. To provide high quality data on the condition, funding availability and services performed by primary schools, primary healthcare facilities and sub-national law and justice services across the country.

Its outputs will be relevant to government stakeholders at all levels - national, provincial, district and local level – and to donors, civil society and others working to improve service delivery performance in PNG.

### Data Pipeline
The NSDTA project implements a comprehensive data analysis pipeline for sector data (education, health, and law & justice) with three distinct phases:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning (R)**: Load raw sector data, clean and standardize it, export to CSV
2. **Schema Organization (SQL)**: Import data into SQLite, construct variables, generate descriptive statistics
3. **Statistical Inference (R)**: Connect to database, perform t-tests and regressions, create visualizations
